bio: "Currently a MSc by Research in Computer Science student at the University of Lincoln. Focused on research into uncomfortable interactions around 'Taphobos: An Immersive Coffin Experience' a game I developed that heavily uses a real life coffin and the Oculus Rift. I've participated in many a gamejam over the past few years and am mainly used to programming/scripting in engines like Unity, Unreal or XNA/Monogame mostly using C#. As well as a bit of android programming in Java. I would be interested in any ideas especially those that would utilise a game and are focused on eliciting emotional responses from individuals."
