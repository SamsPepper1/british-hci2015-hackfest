bio: John is Senior Lecturer in Games Computing, in the Lincoln Social Computing Research Centre at the University of Lincoln, UK. With interests around “creative play in public spaces” his research walks between Computer Science and the Arts. His works has resulted in both academic papers and a large number of public performances and installations, both in the UK and internationally. Prior to the recent move to Lincoln, Shearer was a long-time member of the <a href="http://di.ncl.ac.uk/">Digital Interaction Group</a> based in <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/culturelab/">Culture Lab</a> at Newcastle University, UK. He presently teaches 3D Computer Graphics and Games Programming on the University of Lincoln’s Games Computing programme balancing his ‘softer’ arts and HCI outputs with hardcore technical capabilities. He would say he can’t help but get down and get his hands dirty building in the real world - from art installations and physical computer devices to custom leather work and just about anything that he can get away with.
