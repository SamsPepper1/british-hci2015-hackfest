bio: (Monday only) I completed my BEd in Primary School Education in Linz, Austria with a focus on reform pedagogies and creative and dramatic practice within english as a second language learning. After completing several internships in the field of education and creative practices with orphanages, schools, and social service providers, I completed a MA in Education focusing on International Development. Within this programme, I investigated learning networks, local learning ecologies and natural learning among adults experiencing homelessness in Bucharest, Romania envisioning potentials for HCI and digital technologies. Currently, I am a Doctoral Trainee and have a broad interest in how digital technologies can influence learning with a focus on (peer) networks for sharing (support, information, etc.) among invisible and/or marginalised groups such as youths experiencing homelessness who identify as LGBT+. I am also developing interests in anarchist pedagogy and activism.
