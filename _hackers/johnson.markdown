bio: I am interested in measuring and evaluating the role digital technologies have on the relationship between government, civil society and residents, and how technology can give communities a voice. My research focuses on socio-technical devices enabling bottom-up approaches to civic engagement and grassroots movements. I am passionate about genuine democracy and the ways in which digital technologies encourage open and transparent governance, in the context of a crisis of trust towards large organisations and government. My current research project is focused on a lack of accountability and feedback between governance and people, and the role situated data can play in giving community groups a role in setting the political agenda.
