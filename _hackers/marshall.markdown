bio: I finished my BSc in Computer Science in 2014, with focuses on Human-Computer Interaction and Security. My undergraduate thesis was based in Computer Aided Learning (CAL), which gave me a strong desire to delve more deeply into the fields of pedagogy and how interactive technologies can be incorporated into learning; leading to my involvement in the CDT in Digital Civics at Open Lab. My current research interests are focused on the application of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques and the implementation of transparent practices in local communities and allow them to gather information and build tools. I am also interested in notions of empathy and trust between individuals and organisations.
